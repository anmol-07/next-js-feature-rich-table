# next-js-feature-rich-table

The project uses 2 main parts 
1. Backend - On JSON Server.
2. Frontend - On Next.JS

# JSON Server initialization steps

1. First do cd data-table-app and then npm install to install all the dependencies with node version >= 18.
2. Then do npm run server to start the JSON Server.


# Next JS Server initialization

1. As npm install was done earlier only in other terminal switch to node version >= 18 again.
2. Then again do cd data-table-app and after that do npm run dev, to start the Next.JS server.


# Some improvements which could be done

1. Adding tooltips to show success and failure messages for better user experience.
2. A better hide/show functionality with better UI.
3. Strict validations in the user update/create modal.
4. More API optimizations or better Backend library like Express, Koa etc.
